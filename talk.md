# Introduction to TIC-80

This is TIC-80.

Its name means "Tiny Computer 80" and it is an open source fantasy
console.

Hopefully most of you are used to the concept of "open source", which in 
itself already makes TIC-80 a project that should be worth your attention.
However, I imagine most of you do not know what "fantasy console" means.

You see, one of the worst problems about distributing videogames is that
they are often too tied with the platform they are developed with. This
is because videogames often push the boundaries of what is possible to be
done with a certain machine. And one can't push the boundaries of what is
possible with a machine without knowing it so well that one can even
explore its bugs and defects. The best of example of this boundary pushing
software development certainly is the _demoscene_, where hackers and
enthusiasts constantly amaze their audiences by taking apart every nook
and cranny of their computers and their code and their task at hand to
redefine the boundaries of their platforms. Again, the thing is that, aside
from watching their videos, demos are often bound to a particular kind of
computer, sometimes even to a particular machine that not everyone has
access to, which makes enjoying these kinds of creations very hard at times.

There certain ways of mitigating this problem. One of the most popular ones
is to develop on top a _game engine_. Nowadays, game engines such as 
Unity, Unreal, and Godot allow thousands of game developers around the
world to ship their creations in record time and budget compared to 
historical standards. The idea of the game engine is that development can
be split into 2 parts: engine devs focus on porting the engine to as many
computers as desired by the studio while game devs are allowed to be as free
as possible with their art. In other words: by adding this layer of 
abstraction, game devs are now basically free from the particular details
of whatever machine is running their games. Of course, they might still
need to think about some technical limitations here and there, these are
natural to anything related to computers. We still don't have infinite
memory and hard drives after all. Aside from that, this layer of abstraction
is fundamental for the existence of the current game development industry.

Another way is to do the opposite: instead of trying to reach as many
platforms as possible, one could try to focus on a single machine.

I'm not liking the direction this talk is taking.

It should have a WTF moment.

Right now I'm only talking about random stuff. This is a really
bad introduction to the topic right now.
